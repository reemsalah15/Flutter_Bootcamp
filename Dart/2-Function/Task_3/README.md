# Dart Code for List 

##  List Operations
The first part of the program allows you to perform operations on a map containing key-value pairs (String-Int). It calculates the sum, average, and finds the maximum and minimum values in the map.

### Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the size of the map and provide key-value pairs.

The program will perform the following operations:

- Calculate and print the sum of values in the map.
- Calculate and print the average of values in the map.
- Display the key-value pairs in the map.
- Find and print the maximum and minimum values in the map.
